The Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization Tool is designed as an interactive graphical application developed using Python's Tkinter library. The primary objective is to enable users to visualize and understand the functionality of various pathfinding algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The system is structured to allow intuitive user interactions, such as setting start and end points, adding obstacles, and selecting algorithms.
